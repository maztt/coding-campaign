# coding-campaign

Developed @ **MapaDev Week**, back in May 2022: the original goal for this project was to build an arcade menu using Marvel characters, but as I'm not that into superheroes I just thought of bringing some personal storytelling to the project itself.

Back then I was exploring every kind of programming languages and still wasn't sure about which one to pick. So at that time I just imagined how my doubts could fit in a character selection menu.

Even as a beginner, I knew that there should be a primary language for me to focus but it was also cool to explore everything else. I guess the same thing happens to a lot of us and it is okay to feel that way so just imagine our situation this way, pick a character (or language) for the main campaign but still being able to explore the whole open world with a secondary one.

So with that idea there I am came up up with a mix between anime characters (which some I'm into) and programming languages.



Back then I matched the languages options and characters simply by their color match, but I think you can do some deep analysis with them.


### So how's your Coding Campaign going right now?
