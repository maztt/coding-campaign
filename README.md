# coding-campaign
Developed @ **MapaDev Week**: the original goal for this project was building an arcade menu using Marvel characters, but as I'm not that into superheroes I just thought of bringing some personal stuff to the project itself.

Today I'm looking to learn about different types of language so I just pictured about how my life could fit in that character selection menu.
Even as a beginner, I know that there should be a primary language for me to focus but it is also cool to explore everything else (and even completing secondary quests, especially when it comes to stuff on HTML/CSS/JS).

So with these outputs there I am coming up with anime characters (which some I'm into) and programming languages.



I chose the different language options and characters simply by their color match, but I think you can go through further analysis.


### So how's your Coding Campaign doing right now?
